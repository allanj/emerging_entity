The O

" O
I O

been O
assured O
that O
I O
still O
have O
some O
quality O

" O
he O
said O
, O
saying O
he O
would O
undergo O
a O
new O
form O
of O
chemotherapy O
but O
his O
doctors O
have O
told O
him O
there O
was O
only O
a O
slim O
chance O
of O
a O
cure O
and O
the O
liver O

" O
It O

among O

Surgeons O

, O

. O

He O
made O
a O
rapid O
recovery O

resumed O
most O
of O
his O
duties O
, O
but O
then O
developed O
a O
deteriorating O
condition O
in O
his O
spine O
that O
caused O
him O
great O
pain O
and O
shortened O
his O
height O
by O
several O

. O

He O
was O
scheduled O
to O
undergo O
back O

that O
was O
cancelled O
when O
the O

who O
developed O
a O

much-praised O
programme O
to O

became O
the O
highest-ranking O

ever O
accused O

when O
a O

1993 O
that O
he O
had O
been O
sexually O
abused O
by O

during O
the O
1970s O

Bernardin B-PER
steadfastly O
denied O
the O

later O
recanted O

" O

shook O
him O
